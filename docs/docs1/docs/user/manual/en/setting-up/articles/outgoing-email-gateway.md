#Outgoing Email Gateway

In the Pro Enterprise ERP, you can customize incoming and Outgoing Email Gateway. On saving an Email Account, Pro Enterprise ERP tries establishing a connection with your email gateway. If your Pro Enterprise ERP account is able to connect fine, then Email Account master is saved. If not, then you might receive an error as indicated below.

This indicates that using login credentials and other email gateway details provided, Pro Enterprise ERP is not able to connect to your email server. Please ensure that you have entered valid email credentials for your Email Gateway. Once you have configured Email Account successfully, you should be able to send and receive emails from your Pro Enterprise ERP account fine.

Note: Your Pro Enterprise ERP account is connected with Pro Enterprise ERP email server by default. If you don't want to use your own email server, you can continue sending emails using an Pro Enterprise ERP email server.
