### 2\. Start a Free Account at Pro Enterprise ERP.com


Pro Enterprise ERP.com is managed by the organization (Frappé) that publishes Pro Enterprise ERP.
You can start with your own account by [signing up on the
website](https://enterprise.plus.co.zm).

hosting plans. This way you support the organization that develops and
improves Pro Enterprise ERP. You also get one-to-one functional (usage) support with the
hosting plans.

### 3\. Download a Virtual Machine

To avoid the trouble of installing an instance, Pro Enterprise ERP is available as a
Virtual Image (a full loaded operating system with Pro Enterprise ERP installed). You can
use this on **any** platform including Microsoft Windows.
