# Users And Permissions


In Pro Enterprise ERP, you can create multiple users and assign them different roles. There are some users which can only access the public facing part of Pro Enterprise ERP (i.e. the website). Such users are called "Website Users".

Pro Enterprise ERP implements permission control at the User and Role level. Each user in the system can be assigned multiple
roles and permissions.

The most important role is the "System Manager". Any user having this role can add other users and set roles to all users.
